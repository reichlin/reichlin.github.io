I'm a last year Ph.D. student in the Robotics, Perception and Learning division of the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden.

My work focuses on representation learning from data of interactions and its properties. Applications include: reinforcement learning, multimodal representations, meta-learning and Bayesian neural networks.
