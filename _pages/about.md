I’m a final-year PhD student in the Robotics, Perception and Learning division at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I’m broadly interested in machine learning for decision-making and control.

My research focuses on representation learning from interaction data, with an emphasis on their properties. Applications include: reinforcement learning, multimodal representations, meta-learning and Bayesian neural networks.

For more details, see my PhD [thesis]({{ "/assets/pdf/thesis.pdf" | relative_url }}) (work in progress).
